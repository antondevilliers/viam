### Get Balances Route

API ROUTE : http://localhost:7000/api/v1/balances/msisdn/0829991234






### Postman

#### API - Online Documentations

[https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5601950/UVkvKYBK] (https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5601950/UVkvKYBK)

#### Postman Collection JSON Export:

Location: /POSTMAN_EXPORT_WithReponseExamples/viamedia.postman_collection.son

#### Proof

The /PROOF/ folder contains test-code and response-results for the api/v1/wallet/ route.

This specific API route is very problematic, in that 99.99% of the time it does not work, due to a internal "Cannot read property 'map' of undefined" error. For this I approached this error, via addressing the api/v1/wallet/ & api/v1/rewards API separately, and then via a another route as combined entity.
